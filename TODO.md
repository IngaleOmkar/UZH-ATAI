recommendations todo:
- (?) replace pairwise dist with radius and overlap method 
- (?) LOTR and Forrest Gump -> should yield highly ranked movies -> very specific

- humanness

NER
- E.T. the extraterrestrial NER
- Fuzzy Matching?

Relation Extraction
- "executive prodcuer" does not map to a relation but rather an entity
- IS-A relationships? ddis:specificSubclass 

Question Classification
- failing questions:
    - "how much did Peaceful Warrior make?"
    - "What is the country of citizenship of Cho Geun-hyeon?"
- fallback to other question type when answer is invalid -> avoids problems if classifier fucks up
